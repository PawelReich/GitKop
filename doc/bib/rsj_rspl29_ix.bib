    abstract = { Immediately upon the announcement of Arago’s discovery of the influence of rotating plates of metal upon a magnetic needle (1824), and Faraday’s important discovery of voltaic and magneto-induction (1831), it became evident that the induced currents, circulating in a metallic mass, might be so acted upon either by voltaic or induced currents as to bring-some new light to bear on the molecular construction of metallic bodies. }
