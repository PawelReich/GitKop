    abstract = { In one of my communications to the Cornwall Geological Society on the high temperature of the interior of the earth, I ventured to express a belief that mineral veins, and the internal heat, are connected with electrical action. This opinion, founded as it was on the curious arrangement of the veins, \&amp;c. in pri­mitive rocks, I have had the satisfaction to find confirmed by experiments made in some of the mines of Cornwall; and, I doubt not that the existence of electricity in metalliferous veins similarly circumstanced, and capable of con­ducting it, will prove to be as universal a fact, as the progressive increase of temperature under the earth’s surface is now admitted to be, much as my conclusions on this point were at one time controverted. In my first experiment I did not succeed in detecting any electricity; but in my second I had the gratification to observe considerable electrical action. }
